# Painting-Identification

An image classification tool using Keras. File directories were set up and run locally, so anyone wishing to recreate this program will have to follow the naming conventions in the main part of the code. A powerpoint for the code can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VyjjHEuIJiBKfxIn1F8Pvq5ZSsNoPistgzvFob29geE/edit?usp=sharing
